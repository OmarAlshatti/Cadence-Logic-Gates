# Overview
In this project, we designed and simulated NOR gates, NAND gates, and a 2-bit adder using Cadence Virtuoso in two techniques:

1. Psuedo-NMOS

2. Pass Transistor Logic

We have chosen the TSMC04_4M_2P as the transistor with Lmin = 600nm technology. The standard supply voltage for this transistor is 3.3V and has 5 routing metal layers.

Lastly, we made both layout and schematics in Cadence Virtuoso and matched them using LVS and DRC.
